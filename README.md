Relection Questions: 

What accessibility enhancements were the most challenging to implement, and why?
The most challenging accessibility enhancement to me, was adjusting the color contrast in order to satisfy the WCAG AA contrast ratio threshold.

How do ARIA attributes improve the experience for users relying on assistive technologies?
ARIA attributes essentially translate custom components into accessible experiences so that users relying on screen readers or other assistive technology get the same context and feedback as sighted users. For example: aria-label or aria-labelledby gives names to buttons and controls that donâ€™t have visible labels.

What tools did you use to check color contrast, and how did they help?
I used the Developer tools on Chrome to check the color contrast, and it showed pass/fail directly when inspecting elements.
